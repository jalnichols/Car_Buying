# Car_Buying

Input Radius in miles from Zip 18501

Input Minimum and Maximum price range

Requires some manipulation of Pull records and From_X based on how many listings are available (ie, if there are only 76 records available it will pull in wrong info for FROM_X = 100)

Inside the URL you can adjust ZIP, Start Year, End Year, and other requirements

It outputs a list of listings and then builds a mixed model to estimate price based on Make, Mileage, and Year
